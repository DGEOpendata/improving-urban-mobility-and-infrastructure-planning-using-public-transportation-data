### Project Title: Improving Urban Mobility and Infrastructure Planning Using Public Transportation Data

#### Overview
This project utilizes public transportation usage data to enhance urban mobility and infrastructure planning in Abu Dhabi. By analyzing data on bus, metro, and taxi services, urban planners can optimize routes and schedules, transportation authorities can allocate resources more effectively, and researchers can study trends in public transportation adoption.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- matplotlib

#### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/urban-mobility-planning.git
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   bash
   cd urban-mobility-planning
   
3. Install the required packages:
   bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   

#### Usage
1. Load and explore the dataset:
   - Place the `Public_Transport_Usage_Abu_Dhabi.xlsx` file in the project directory.
   - Run the Python script `analyze_transport_data.py` to visualize peak usage times and popular routes.

2. Analyze Peak Usage Times:
   - The script will output a plot showing peak public transportation usage times, allowing planners to adjust schedules accordingly.

3. Identify Popular Routes:
   - The script will also output a bar chart of the top 5 most popular routes, which can inform resource allocation and route planning.
